# Leo Commit

## Workflow

- Check `git status` and confirm there are staged changes.
- If there are only unstaged changes, ask whether to stage them (prefer explicit confirmation before `git add -A`).
- Run `leocommit` and capture its stdout as the commit message (trim leading/trailing whitespace).
- If `leocommit` returns empty output or errors, stop and ask how to proceed.
- Create a new commit with `git commit -m "<message>"`.
- Do not amend or rewrite history unless explicitly asked.

## Output Expectations

- Share the exact commit message used.
- If a commit is not created, explain why and what is needed next.
